Add unobstrusive links to next/previous products on your WooCommerce single product pages.

== Description ==

A simple plugin that displays next and previous links on single product pages. A product thumbnail is displayed with the title revealed on hover. Products are ordered chronologically and the display can be customised in the Customizer.

This plugin requires both the WooCommerce eCommerce plugin and the Storefront theme to be installed.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `storefront-product-pagination` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Configure the display in the Customizer (look for the 'Product Pagination' section).
3. Done!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I installed the plugin but cannot see the links =

First of all it's important to note that this plugin requires that <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/">WooCommerce</a> be installed, and that you use the <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/storefront/">Storefront</a> theme.

The links will appear on any single product page, providing there is more than one product at your store.
